Solutions to problems 1-10 can be found in the `src/Problems/` folder.

## Setup

To **install**, clone or download the repository.

In the project folder, run the command:

```javascript
npm install
```

then,

```javascript
npm start
```

## Example Problems

Each problem is slightly more complex than the last. Here are some of the first 10 problems:

```
1.
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
```

```
4.
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
```

```
5.
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
```

```
10.
The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.

Find the sum of all the primes below two million.
```
